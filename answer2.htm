You enjoy talking and listening. Social activities are part of your daily life. Interacting with people, learning from their experiences and stories satisfies your curiosity. In this paralife, your subjects are even more fascinating. You find Frankenstein and hear his complaints about loneliness and singleness for three days. You chat with Dracula and stay over night in his castle. You hang out with Skeleton Nick and share his happiness in taking a part-time job at a local School of Medicine. Based on your experiences with unknown creatures, you become a biography writer unfolding their mysterious lives.
