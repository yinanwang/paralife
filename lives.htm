				<p class="story mb">Based on the answers, you are <br><span class="title">An Anime Scenery Photographer</span></p>
				<p class="story" style="width: 360px;">
You are totally an adventurer. Seeing and experiencing the same thing day after day couldn&#146;t be more boring. In this paralife you are a freelance photographer (mostly working for <span class="name">Animation Geographic Magazine</span>). You travel inside eastern animes and western cartoons shooting artistic and exotic scenery in animation worlds. Since you are not crazy about social life, normally you just stay in your spaceship drifting around cartoon worlds, writing articles, reading, creating new recipes and planning for the next trip.

				<p class="story">
You enjoy talking and listening. Social activities are part of your daily life. Interacting with people, learning from their experiences and stories satisfies your curiosity. In this paralife, your subjects are even more fascinating. You find Frankenstein and hear his complaints about loneliness and singleness for three days. You chat with Dracula and stay over night in his castle. You hang out with Skeleton Nick and share his happiness in taking a part-time job at a local School of Medicine. Based on your experiences with unknown creatures, you become a biography writer unfolding their mysterious lives.

				<p class="story mb">Based on the answers, you are <br><span class="title">A Time Machine Builder</span></p>
				<p class="story">
You love science and truth. It&#146;s not easy for you to give up seeking answers once you start an investigation and research. In this paralife, you are a scientist working with a group of geniuses to build time machine. You&#146;ve been dreaming about such a tool to send people back in time to see how history actually happened. For example, why was Stonehenge created and who was Jack the Ripper? With the success of your time machine, you go back and forth thoughout human history recording the truth of unsolved mysteries. Later your documentary series <span class="name">UNVEIL</span> become a massive hit.

				<p class="story mb">Based on the answers, you are <br><span class="title">A Marine Organism Gardener</span></p>
				<p class="story">
You like a quiet, steady and peaceful life. The fewer changes, the better. In this paralife, you are a gardener living under the sea, not far from the continental shelf, so you have sufficient sunlight for you and your marine organism plantation. The plants are mainly grown for the Marine Ecosystem Recovery Program. But you also sell bonsai to marine residents since you have a good taste in art. You live in a glass house with your family. Each day after work in plantation, you write novels for fun and stay on the surface of the sea for sunset. Now and then you like taking a family trip to the land. What a wonderful life.
