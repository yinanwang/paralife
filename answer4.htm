</span></p>
				<p class="story">
You like a quiet, steady and peaceful life. The fewer changes, the better. In this paralife, you are a gardener living under the sea, not far from the continental shelf, so you have sufficient sunlight for you and your marine organism plantation. The plants are mainly grown for the Marine Ecosystem Recovery Program. But you also sell bonsai to marine residents since you have a good taste in art. You live in a glass house with your family. Each day after work in plantation, you write novels for fun and stay on the surface of the sea for sunset. Now and then you like taking a family trip to the land. What a wonderful life.
